<h1>My Tech Journey</h1><br />
<h2>Day 1: Learning HTML</h2>

<p>Today i learned that HTML is <strong> not programming language;</strong> it is a<br>
<b>markup language</b> that stuctures web content.
<p>I also learned how to make text <i>italic</i> and <strong>bold</strong>.
<p>My Name is Racel Mamauag</p>
<p>I made my first HTML file today.<br> 
Then I opened it in my browser.</p>
<p>I was <em>so happy</em> when I saw my page finally work.</p>
<p><b><i>This part should be strong and emphasized</i></b></p>
